## Available Agents

### Kubernetes Troubleshooting Agent

An AI-powered agent for troubleshooting Kubernetes clusters using natural language queries, available as a REST API.

For detailed information about installation, configuration, and usage of the Kubernetes agent, please refer to the [Kubernetes Agent README](./k8s/README.md) in the `k8s` directory.

## Other Agents
